A simple program with a GUI to have a smooth audio output

This simple app allows you to have a stable audio master volume by setting it constantly according to the intensity of what you are listening.

Or in short :
- When they whisper in the movie, it puts the volume UP
- When there is an explosion, it puts the volume DOWN

![The GUI](https://github.com/extraltodeus/VolumeAssistant/blob/master/Screenshot.png?raw=true)

The correction slider will set the intensity of the correction... The sweet unnoticeable spot is 0.5

The length slider is about the duration of the latest analysis. Higher = smoother changes. 0 = Instant correction (default)

Some presets are available from the menu to make your life easier.
